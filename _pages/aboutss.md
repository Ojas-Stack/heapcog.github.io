Welcome to my site. This site has been built with Github pages and Jekyll. I will be sharing my thoughts on various areas, this may cover technology, science, math, photography etc...


## Technology

> Started with various programming languages Fortan, Pascal, COBOL, C, C++, MFC, VC++, VB, VB.Net, and C#. 
After leanrning VB I've steered towards Microsoft technologies and spent most of my time with .Net technologies in the last two decades.
Currently I'm exploring Python & A.I.
